# NYC-SAT-scores-analysis


This project is all about data analysis.

In order to analyze the NYC SAT scores from high schools in different districts, and of different racial origin I used several databases:

+ SAT scores by school — SAT scores for each high school in New York City.
+ School attendance — attendance information on every school in NYC.
+ Math test results — math test results for every school in NYC.
+ Class size — class size information for each school in NYC.
+ AP test results — Advanced Placement exam results for each high school. Passing AP exams can get you college credit in the US.
+ Graduation outcomes — percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.
+ Demographics — demographic information for each school.
+ School survey — surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school.
+ School district maps — contains information on the layout of the school districts, so that we can map them out.

All of which are taken from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4.
